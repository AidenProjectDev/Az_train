Hello, az_train is a complete train management script on FiveM, it allows you to have train garages, container inventories synchronized between all players and train robberies. All this for obviously 0 euros and totally open source. DLC will probably come later to add content to the script, free DLC of course that will be available on my discord so feel free to join.

The robberies are a point that makes the originality of the script, it will allow you to make your commercial crossroads dangerous if people decide to steal an important cargo, the associated commands to make the robberies are marked below. The bombs allowing to stop the train also allow to bring an important point for your server which is the demining of this one, create a branch LSPD or BSCO which will be able to deminer the bombs. (finally a script which allows you to use the EOD of London script: https://forum.cfx.re/t/bomb-disposal-robot-eod-remote-control-controlled-explosion-water-jet-night-vision-paid-resource/1798119)

Here are the commands to know:
- posebombtrain : to put a bomb on a track, if a train comes close to it it will derail and its containers will be accessible to all
- removebomb : to remove the nearest bomb 
- rerail : to put your train back on the tracks  

Thanks to all the testers of the Discord who helped a lot to find bugs and make suggestions, if you want to be part of it I invite you to go on the official Discord !
